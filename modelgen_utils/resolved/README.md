# Resolved Models

Resolved openapi models from the code-generation script.

Used to build the models and views present in [api_models](api_models).

This is only used for new BrAPI releases **only**.

**DO NOT** use these models to overwrite [api_models](api_models), specially if you don't know what you are doing.
